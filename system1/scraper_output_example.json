      "description": "Architecturally inspiring, Oskar is a luxury rental property designed by CetraRuddy.\nSerene and peaceful, the lobby reflects more the sensibilities of an art gallery than a residential building as it boasts an impressive collection of work by Phillip Michaels. A sculpture garden and sky-lit reflective pond house a glistening, mirror-polished sculpture by the renowned artist, Arik Levy. And as abundant light pours in from the sundrenched corridors, the elements of this lobby come together to create a space that is both grand and intimate. Oskar Luxury Apartments is an apartment community located in New York County and the 10036 ZIP Code. This area is served by the New York City Geographic District # 2 attendance zone.",
