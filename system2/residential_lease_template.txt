#2. Term, Move‑In, and Renewal

**Lease Start Date:** {{ lease_start_date }}  
**Lease End Date:** {{ lease_end_date }}  
**Effective Date (date signed):** {{ effective_date }}

2.1 **Initial term**  
Landlord leases the Premises to Resident, and Resident leases from Landlord, for the term beginning on the Lease Start Date and ending on the Lease End Date, unless ended sooner under this Lease or applicable law.

2.2 **Availability of premises**  
If, for reasons beyond Landlord’s reasonable control, the Premises are not ready for occupancy on the Lease Start Date, the Lease will begin as soon as the Premises are reasonably ready. Landlord is not liable for delay damages, but Rent will be adjusted so Resident does not pay Rent for any period when the Premises are not available.

2.3 **Automatic month‑to‑month renewal (optional)**  
After the Lease End Date, if Resident remains in possession **with Landlord’s consent** and no new written lease is signed, this Lease converts to a month‑to‑month tenancy under the same terms except that:
- The monthly Rent may change to Landlord’s then‑current market rent, and  
- Either party may terminate with at least {{ month_to_month_notice_days }} days’ written notice before the next monthly period.

#3. Rent and Payment Terms

**Monthly Rent:** ${{ monthly_rent }}  
**Due Date:** On or before the {{ rent_due_day }} of each month, by {{ rent_due_time }} local time.

3.1 **Place and method of payment**  
Resident must pay Rent without notice or demand, in lawful U.S. funds, by one of the methods approved by Landlord, which may include:
- Online payments via the property portal (for example, Apartments.com or a similar system), or  
- Other methods designated in writing by Landlord.

3.2 **First month / prorated Rent**  
If the Lease Start Date is not the first day of a month, the first month’s Rent will be prorated based on a daily rate (Monthly Rent divided by the number of days in that month). The prorated amount is due at or before move‑in, together with any other move‑in amounts.

3.3 **Other recurring monthly charges (if any)**  
If applicable, Resident agrees to pay the following additional monthly charges (leave blank or “0.00” if none):

- Parking / Garage / Carport: ${{ parking_monthly_amount }} per month  
- Storage Unit: ${{ storage_monthly_amount }} per month  
- Washer / Dryer or Appliance Rental: ${{ appliance_rental_monthly_amount }} per month  
- Other agreed recurring charge: {{ other_monthly_description }} – ${{ other_monthly_amount }} per month  

These amounts are due with Monthly Rent and are treated as part of the total amount owed each month.

3.4 **No set‑off**  
Except where required by law, Resident may not withhold or offset Rent or other sums owed under this Lease based on any claim against Landlord.

---

#4. Late Fees and Returned Payments

**Grace Period (if any):** {{ grace_period_days }} days after the Due Date  
**Flat Late Charge:** ${{ late_fee_flat_amount }}

4.1 **Late charges**  
If Landlord does not receive the total Monthly Rent by the end of the grace period (if any), Resident must pay the Late Charge listed above as additional amounts under this Lease. Time is of the essence for all payments.

4.2 **Returned / rejected payments**  
If any check or electronic payment is dishonored, returned, rejected, or reversed, Resident must pay:
- The unpaid amount,  
- Any applicable Late Charge (if Rent is late), and  
- A **returned payment fee** of ${{ returned_payment_fee }}.

After {{ returned_payment_limit }} or more returned payments, Landlord may require all future payments to be made by cashier’s check, certified check, or money order.

---

#5. Security Deposit

**Security Deposit Amount:** ${{ security_deposit_amount }}

5.1 **Purpose**  
The Security Deposit secures Resident’s performance of all obligations under this Lease. It is **not** an advance payment of Rent and may not be used by Resident as Rent.

5.2 **Use of deposit**  
Landlord may use the Security Deposit, as permitted by law, to cover:
- Unpaid Rent or other amounts due under this Lease,  
- Costs to repair damage beyond normal wear and tear,  
- Costs to clean the Premises to restore it to move‑in condition (allowing for normal wear and tear), and  
- Other lawful charges allowed by applicable law.

If Landlord uses any portion of the Security Deposit during the term, Resident agrees to promptly restore it to the original amount upon written notice.

5.3 **Return and accounting**  
Within the time required by law after the Lease ends and Resident surrenders the Premises, Landlord will:
- Provide a written accounting of any deductions, and  
- Return any remaining balance of the Security Deposit to the Resident’s forwarding address on file.

If there are multiple Residents, Landlord may issue a single refund check payable jointly to all Residents.

Landlord will provide and pay for the following utilities or services, if applicable:

Landlord may change providers or methods of billing as allowed by law, including sub‑metering or ratio billing, upon giving any required notice.

6.3 **Transfer and continuity**  
Resident must place required utilities into Resident’s name on or before the Lease Start Date and keep them active through the end of the Lease term. Resident is responsible for any utility charges or fees that result from failure to timely establish, maintain, or discontinue service.

6.4 **Interruption of service**  
Landlord is not liable for interruption or failure of utilities not supplied directly by Landlord, or for interruptions beyond Landlord’s reasonable control. Landlord will use reasonable efforts to restore any Landlord‑supplied utility service.

Resident shall use the Premises solely as a private residence and for no unlawful purpose. Running a business that brings frequent customers or deliveries, or violates zoning or law, is prohibited.

Guests may visit from time to time, but any person staying more than {{ guest_nights_limit }} consecutive days, or more than {{ guest_total_days_per_period }} total days in any {{ guest_period_description }}, may be considered an unauthorized occupant unless approved in writing by Landlord.

7.3 **Conduct and criminal activity**  
Resident, Occupants, and guests must not engage in criminal activity in or near the Premises, or conduct that threatens the health, safety, or peaceful enjoyment of others. Serious or repeated violations may be treated as a material, non‑curable breach of this Lease, subject to applicable law.
