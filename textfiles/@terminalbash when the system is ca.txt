@terminal:bash when the system is calling the  apify api and is scraping listings a notice should be shown to the users in order not to get them board while waiting. for example a display message can be shown like "Retrieving Listings >" and when the user clikc on it, they can be able to see the scraping log for example and the it get hidden again after the agent start responding. this is not strict requirement; if you have a better idea to not get the user board while waiting you may implement it instead.
