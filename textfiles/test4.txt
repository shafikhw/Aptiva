Good evening! I’d love to help you find a rental property in Lebanon. To get started, could you please clarify a few things for me?

What type of property are you looking for (apartment, house, etc.)?
Do you have a specific city or neighborhood in mind?
What is your budget for rent?
How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need?
Are you looking for a furnished property?
Once I have this information, I can assist you better!
